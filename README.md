# Discription for the solution
Given model is made to provide user with great headlines for the news as one only need to put lines or few sentenses on even similar headlines and the model will suggest better solution or headlines as a result.

Not only the code I will provide you with the screen shot of the model with an of NFT example.

The model is an API of a very powerful and popular algorithem called GPT-3.

# How to check
You need to type this command on your command prompt to activate a local server where this application will work as I have not deployed it on an live server for various reasons thus, you need to write.
